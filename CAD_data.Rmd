Predictors that significantly affect which agency responds compared to CAHOOTS 
REJECT NULL HYPOTHESIS
-animal related crimes, assistance request, drug related,medical emergencies, mental health crises, time of day night, public disturbance, suspicious activity, theft and property crimes, vehicle accident, violent crimes, time of day afternoon

Predictors that do not significantly affect agency response odds compared to CAHOOTS
-traffic violations
warrants and arrests

Most predictors are statistically significant which means that incident type and time of day influence whether EPD or Other agencies respond versus CAHOOTS
